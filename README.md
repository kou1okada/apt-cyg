Requirements
------------

`apt-cyg` requires the Cygwin default environment and the additional *Cygwin* packages:

`wget`, `ca-certificates`, `gnupg`, `libiconv`

In **32bit** version of cygwin, `wget` requires an additional setting for the `ca-certificates` package.
Choose one of below settings.

    # 1. Create symbolic link for the default ca-directory of wget. 
    ln -s /usr/ssl /etc/
    
    # or
    # 2. Set ca-directory paramete in '/etc/wgetrc'. 
    echo "ca-directory = /usr/ssl/certs" >> /etc/wgetrc
    
    # or
    # 3. Set ca-directory paramete in '~/.wgetrc'. 
    echo "ca-directory = /usr/ssl/certs" >> ~/.wgetrc

Remarks:
Above additional settings for wget is not required for 64bit version of cygwin.
But, as of 2014-01-17, perhaps `ca-certificates` package makes fail of certification in 64bit version of cygwin with Windows 8. See below:

* Known Problem / [2014-01-17: ca-certificates package is not setup correct at x86_64 with Windows 8.](#2014-01-17-ca-certificates-package-is-not-setup-correct-at-x86_64-with-windows-8)

Quick start
-----------

The most recommended way to deploy this fork can be seen from a link below:
* New features / [Upgrade apt-cyg](#upgrade-apt-cyg)

apt-cyg is a simple script. Once you have a copy, make it executable:

    chmod +x /bin/apt-cyg

Optionally place apt-cyg in a bin/ folder on your path.

Then use apt-cyg, for example:

    apt-cyg install nano

New features
------------

### dist-upgrade support

This fork has achieved `dist-upgrade` command by using `setup-x86.exe` and `setup-x86_64.exe` as a backend.
Note that all of running tasks on the cygwin will be killed before starting dist-upgrade.

### Multiple hash algorithms support

After the middle of 2015-03, the cygwin project changed the hash algorithm for checking tarball from md5 to sha512.
But, as of 2015-04-09, the cygwinports project seems still using md5.
This fork is available for both of cygwin and cygwinports by supporting algorithm of md5, sha1, sha224, sha256 and sha512.

### Signature check and key management by GnuPG

The default action of apt-cyg has been changed to check signature for 'setup.ini'.
Of course you can also avoid signature check by using `--no-verify` or `-X` options.
Public keys of cygwin and cygwinports are already registered to trusted keys of embeded.
If you want to use some other public keys, please use `key-*` subcommands.

### Upgrade apt-cyg

If apt-cyg is under Git version control, this fork can upgrade itself by `upgrade-self` subcommand.
Therefore, the most recommended way to deploy this fork is `copy and paste` below commands to cygwin console:

    # cd $DIR # Change working directory where you want to install apt-cyg
    git clone https://github.com/kou1okada/apt-cyg.git
    ln -s "$(realpath apt-cyg/apt-cyg)" /usr/local/bin/

If you want to use another fork, which forked from https://github.com/kou1okada/apt-cyg, rewrite the URL for apropriate one.

### Proxy support

Use `--proxy`, `-p` option.
This option must take a parameter from one of "auto", "inherit", "none" and URL.

* "auto" will determine a proxy using a part of the [Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Proxy_Autodiscovery_Protocol).
The current implementation will look for a string of "PROXY URL" from "http://wpad/wpad.dat".
If "wpad.dat" could not be downloaded, the proxy settings are inherited from the parent environment.
* "inherit" will inherit the proxy settings from the parent environment.
* "none" will not use the proxy.
* URL can take a string like "protocol://hostname:port".

For example:

    apt-cyg --proxy http://proxy.home:8080 update

The default parameter is "${APT\_CYG\_PROXY:-auto}".
At the environment where is not provided the WPAD server, it makes the lag for a few seconds at startup.
So, if you don't want to use WPAD, please define APT\_CYG\_PROXY environment variable as below:

    export APT_CYG_PROXY=inherit

### Bash completion support

Bash completion script can be installed  to "/etc/bash_completion.d/apt-cyg" by `completion-install` subcommand.
It will be automatically updated when apt-cyg is upgraded to newer version.
If you don't want to update it automatically, execute `completion-install` subcommand in conjunction with `--completion-disable-autoupdate` option. And `completion-uninstall` subcommand removes "/etc/bash_completion.d/apt-cyg".

Some other forks, [Milly / apt-cyg](https://github.com/Milly/apt-cyg) under the cfg / apt-cyg fork, [ashumkin / apt-cyg](https://github.com/ashumkin/apt-cyg) and etc, are also supported it.

### Forks on the github

Caution:
Please do not merge forks that have incompatible licenses.

Ex.) Merging to the GPL from the MIT is possible. But merging to the MIT from the GPL  is impossible.

See [other_forks.md](other_forks.md)

Todo
------------

- [ ] Support multi mirrors: Cygwin setup can use multi mirrors. They are recorded at last-mirror section in '/etc/setup/setup.rc'. It's useful for using [Cygwinports](http://cygwinports.org/).
- [ ] Support upgrade: But maybe, busy resources can not be upgraded, and rebase problem will happen. Cygwin setup resolves by replacing them at next reboot.
- [ ] Support dependency check for remove subcommand.
